This package contains interfaces designed to create a foundation for a POS System.

They provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to objects which associate with entities in
a Database System, as well as the functionality of classes to query and update tables and entities in said
database.

These interfaces should allow a developer to integrate front end and back end operations of their system
through a database.
